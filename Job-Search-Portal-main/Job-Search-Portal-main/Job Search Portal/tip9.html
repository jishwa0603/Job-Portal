            <p>Enthusiasm is a critical component of reaching your career goals. Here’s how you can properly convey enthusiasm in your next interview to land a job.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ask for the job</strong><br>
                    It sounds ridiculously simple, but one of the easiest ways to demonstrate your enthusiasm is to come right out and ask for the job. At the very least, tell the interviewer that you are excited and interested in the company and job.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Say everyone’s names</strong><br>
                    This small touch makes a big difference. When you take the time to repeat and say people’s names—from the receptionist to your interviewer—it shows you’re interested beyond just the interview. It can also send the message that you’re already a part of the team!</li>
                
                <li><strong>Project the right body language</strong><br>
                    Body language can send unspoken messages. Ensure it accurately conveys your enthusiasm by making eye contact, smiling, nodding, and facing the interviewer with your shoulders.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Send a thank you note</strong><br>
                    After the interview, solidify your enthusiasm by sending a thank you note to your interviewer(s). Mention a key discussion point from the interview to reinforce your interest and suitability for the job.</li>
            </ol>
